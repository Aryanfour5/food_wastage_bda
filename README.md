Food Waste Prediction using Big Data and Machine Learning
Overview

Food waste is a major global concern, leading to resource loss, hunger, and environmental degradation. This project aims to predict food waste patterns using Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning models to provide insights and actionable recommendations. By analyzing large-scale datasets from restaurants, households, and supply chains, the system helps reduce food waste through data-driven decision-making.

Features

Data Ingestion: Collects and integrates data from multiple sources (FAO, Kaggle, restaurant logs, etc.)

Data Preprocessing: Cleans, normalizes, and transforms data using Spark

Prediction Module: Trains ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to forecast food waste volumes

Visualization: Generates dashboards using Power BI or Matplotlib

Storage: Manages scalable data storage using Hadoop HDFS or MongoDB

Security: Implements data encryption and restricted access

Containerization: Uses Docker for consistent deployment

Methodology

Data Collection: Gather data from FAO, Kaggle, and local food sources.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature selection.

Model Training: Use Random Forest and XGBoost models for predictive analysis.

Data Storage: Store cleaned and processed data in HDFS or MongoDB.

Visualization: Create dashboards to display insights and trends.

Evaluation: Measure performance using metrics like RMSE and accuracy.

Results and Discussion

The predictive models demonstrated high accuracy in estimating food waste trends based on consumption, weather, and seasonal demand. Visual dashboards enabled stakeholders to identify key causes of waste and plan interventions effectively. The combination of Big Data frameworks and Machine Learning improved scalability, performance, and reliability in waste prediction.

Conclusion and Future Scope

The project successfully integrates Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning to address the issue of food waste. Future enhancements include real-time data streaming using Apache Kafka, deeper neural network models for improved accuracy, and integration with IoT sensors for dynamic monitoring across the food supply chain.
